		<h2><li id="2">  Investigation </li></h2>
              <p>I looked at several websites to get ideas on how to present my data on the final webpage. 
              I took particular notice of Ireland’s COVID-19 Data Hub; I felt that it was a good standard 
              to aim for, and I liked the various filtering users could perform on the data using dropdown 
              menus and sliders, along with the ability to hover over graphs and charts to view figures.</p>
              <p>I also looked at data.gov.ie, which contained lots of open data pertaining to Irish statistics. 
              There was a wide variety of data available and lots of different filtering options and chart types. 
              I also liked the idea of displaying the dataset underneath the charts.</p>
              <p>Finally, I also looked at gapminder, which used chart types like a line graph, bubble chart and 
              pyramid along with a time slider to display data relating to environmental and social issues across 
              the world. It also had a play button which animated the data and I could see emerging trends.</p>
              <p>I liked elements from all 3 information systems, but the key elements that I wanted to keep in my 
                information system were that ability to filter data, hover over data points and displaying the 
                original dataset with the graphs.</p>

              <p>I chose to use the CSO dataset on Median Annual Earnings in Ireland from 2011-2023, by Economic 
                Sector and Sex, for the following reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Plenty of numerical data: unlike the other datasets I looked at, this dataset had lots of numerical 
                  values to work with, those being the figures for annual earnings and the annual change % of those 
                  earnings.</li>
                <li>Already studied this topic thoroughly: I am also studying Economics for my Leaving Cert, and for our 
                  Research Project this year, we were required to investigate wage changes in a particular economic sector. 
                  While conducting that research I studied this dataset, among others, and thus am well versed on the topic 
                  and knew it would be suitable for the project. Due to this, I did not need to do much more research into 
                  this topic.</li>
                <li>Reasonable size: the other datasets that I looked at were quite large with lots of variables, presenting a 
                  daunting challenge. When downloading the dataset from the CSO, I was able to pick and choose what aspects 
                  of the data I wanted to download - I opted for median rather than mean annual earnings and I decided not to 
                  include age as another variable.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Testing Overview</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When undergoing the testing process for this project, I encountered several issues that I was able to address 
                and improve my code. I employed different types of testing such as unit testing, function testing, system testing, regression testing, and 
                black box testing.</strong></p>

              <p>Here are some problems I noticed during testing and how they were fixed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>No protection against invalid data:</strong> Although my dataset from the CSO contained no errors, I tried 
                  removing some values or changing them to incorrect data types to see how the system would handle them. I then added a 
                  function to check if the original dataset has missing values or incorrect data types and to stop the programme if there are.</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate Dash apps issue:</strong> When attempting to integrate a second Dash app into my system, an error 
                  occurred where the first app was rendered twice. This was due to an error where I hadn’t properly named the callback function 
                  in my Flask server and had mistakenly called for the first app in my HTML. I was able to fix this error by renaming the relevant 
                  code blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>No form validation for negative numbers:</strong> When submitting negative numbers to the survey asking users what they 
                  believe the gender pay gap to be, no error was raised and this data was added to the database. To fix this I added a validate form 
                  function to the relevant HTML file that only accepts values more than 0.</li>
                <li><strong>No error handling for empty survey database:</strong> When users view the survey page without any previous data submitted, 
                  no error message was displayed to indicate there was an issue, rather the statistics and database were displayed with no values. I 
                  fixed this by ensuring that if the database was empty, a message would be displayed explaining the issue.</li>
              </ul>

              &lt;/form&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>This method failed to submit the form data to a poll but instead appended the data to the URL. I investigated this 
                issue and found the difference between the GET and POST method, and was able to adjust my code accordingly:</p>
              <pre>
              &lt;form onsubmit="submitPoll(event)" method="post"&gt;
                &lt;!-- Form fields here --&gt;
                &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
              &lt;/form&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>This fix ensured that the form data was properly sent in a manner that could be read by SQLite and inserted into the 
                survey database.</p>
              
              <h3>Database Issues After Updating Code</h3>
              <p>As I was constructing the form I ended up adding in new questions. When I attempted to run the new code I was getting the 
                following error in the terminal:</p>
              <pre>
              ("INSERT INTO responses (sector, factors, payGap, gov) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", 
              sqlite3.OperationalError: table responses has no column named gov
              </pre>
              <p>The issue was that after adding in a new question, I was attempting to pass data to the responses table in my SQLite database 
                under the column gov, which wasn’t in the database. Thankfully the fix was relatively simple as I just had to delete the existing 
                database and ensure the new one that would be created would include the gov column:</p>
              <pre>
              # Initialise the SQLite database
              def init_db():
                 conn = sqlite3.connect('survey.db')
                 cursor = conn.cursor()
                 # Add in the column for the responses to the government question
                 cursor.execute('''
                      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS responses (
                         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                         sector TEXT,
                         factors TEXT,
                         payGap REAL,
                         gov BOOLEAN
                     )
                  ''')
                  conn.commit()
                  conn.close()
              
              init_db()
              </pre>              
              <h3>Analytics Algorithm</h3>
              <p>Here is a snippet of my code, showcasing my getSummary function:</p>
              <pre>
              # Get summary statistics function
              def getSummary(df, groupByColumn):
                  
                  # Group data by the specified column
                  groups = {group: data for group, data in df.groupby(groupByColumn)}
                  
                  # Initialize a list to store the results
                  results = []
                  
                  # Iterate over each group to calculate summary statistics for mean, 
                    median, max and min values
                  for name, group in groups.items():
                      meanValues = group.mean(numeric_only=True).round(2)
                      medianValues = group.median(numeric_only=True).round(2)

                      minValue = group.min(numeric_only=True).round(2)
                      
                      # Create a dictionary with the summary statistics for the

                          'Min Annual Earnings': minValue.get('Median Annual Earnings 
                          (€)', None),
                          'Mean Annual Change': meanValues.get('Annual Change (%)', 
                          None),

                          'Min Annual Change': minValue.get('Annual Change (%)', 
                          None),
                      }
                      # Append the result to the results list
                      results.append(result)
                  
                  # Create a dataframe from the results list
                  summary = pd.DataFrame(results)
                  
                  # Return the summary statistics and the grouped data
                  return summary, groups
              </pre>
              
              <p>Here is a breakdown of how this works:</p>
              <pre>
              # Get summary statistics function
              def getSummary(df, groupByColumn):
              </pre>
              <p>This  defines the function getSummary, which takes in two variables: df and groupByColumn</p>
              
              <pre>
               # Group data by the specified column
                  groups = {group: data for group, data in df.groupby(groupByColumn)}
              </pre>
              <p>This line groups the dataframe `df` by the specified column groupByColumn. It creates a dictionary groups where the keys are the
                 unique values of the specified column, and the values are the corresponding subsets of the dataframe.</p>
              
              <pre>
              # Initialize a list to store the results
                  results = []
              </pre>
              <p>This line initializes an empty list results to store the summary statistics for each group.</p>

              <pre>
                  # Iterate over each group to calculate summary statistics for mean, 
                    median, max and min values
                  for name, group in groups.items():
              </pre>
              <p>This line starts a loop that iterates over each group in the groups dictionary. name is the key (unique value of the specified column), 
              and group is the corresponding subset of the dataframe.</p>
              
              <pre>
                      meanValues = group.mean(numeric_only=True).round(2)
                      medianValues = group.median(numeric_only=True).round(2)
                      maxValue = group.max(numeric_only=True).round(2)
                      minValue = group.min(numeric_only=True).round(2)
              </pre>
              <p>These lines calculate the mean, median, maximum and minimum values of the numeric columns in the current group. The numeric_only=True  
              parameter ensures that only numeric columns are considered, and the .round(2) method rounds the value to 2 decimal places</p>
              
              <pre>
                      # Create a dictionary with the summary statistics for the 
                        current group
                      result = {
                          group_by_column: name,
                          'Mean Annual Earnings': meanValues.get('Median Annual

                          'Max Annual Earnings': maxValue.get('Median Annual Earnings 
                          (€)', None),
                          'Min Annual Earnings': minValue.get('Median Annual Earnings 
                          (€)', None),
                          'Mean Annual Change': meanValues.get('Annual Change (%)', 
                          None),
                          'Median Annual Change': medianValues.get('Annual Change  
                          (%)', None),
                          'Max Annual Change': maxValue.get('Annual Change (%)', 
                          None),
                          'Min Annual Change': minValue.get('Annual Change (%)', 
                          None),
                      }
              </pre>
              <p>These lines create a dictionary, result,  that stores all of the summary statistics calculated above</p>
              
              <pre>
                      # Append the result to the results list
                      results.append(result)
              </pre>
              <p>The result dictionary is then appended to the results list</p>
              
              <pre>
                  # Create a dataframe from the results list
                  summary = pd.DataFrame(results)
              </pre>
              <p>This is then converted into a dataframe called summary</p>
              
              <pre>
                  # Return the summary statistics and the grouped data
                  return summary, groups
              </pre>
              <p>Finally, the summary dataframe and the groups dictionary are returned</p>
              
              <p>The summary data can now be displayed on the information system and the groups dictionaries' sexes and years are used later in creating graphs.</p>



		<h2><li id="5"> Evaluation </li></h2>
    <p><strong>Does the project meet the requirements?</strong></p>
    <p>I believe that my project fulfils all of the requirements in the brief to a reasonably good to high standard. However, I feel like Advanced 
      Requirement 3 wasn't fully clear on whether any actual code was supposed to be used or if it was simply your opinions based on your analysis 
      which leaves me unsure if it was answered correctly.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, I am particularly proud of the Dash apps. Having previous experience with pandas and graphing in python, one of the 
      challenges that I set for myself was to create a dynamic graph with dropdown menu functionality, and I am quite pleased that I managed to make it work.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>How would I further improve/iterate on this project?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>One big improvement I would have liked to make on my project would be to better the styling on the information system. As is, I did very 
        little to style the project and used only basic colours. It also may have helped to include more images.</li>
      <li>Another improvement I would have liked to have done would be a page where the different economic sectors were explained in case any of the 
        names were unclear or confusing.</li>
      <li>The survey is another aspect I'd like to see improved, it is rather basic as of now but more in-depth analysis such as correlation analysis 
        could reveal deeper insights into issues like the gender pay gap.</li>
      <li>Finally, I think it could be interesting to look into optimising the system for mobile, something I've never done before as this would prove 
        an interesting challenge and would make the artefact more accessible.</li>
